## Perry's Notes
[I couldn't find you to do an in person review. If you have questions, check in with me when you are back in class.]Hey caleb! Good start on your project. Good separation of front/backend, good logic, good formatting. :D

Some areas still need work. Please fix and resubmit.

Specs are not quite accurate: See https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intro-to-programming/arrays-looping/homework-behavior-driven-development one more time. Example: Input: 2 Output: [1,2] Input: 3 Output [1,2, "ping"] etc. Build them step by step. Start with simplest (aka just numbers) See: http://postimg.org/image/wr5o3k753/ *No custom CSS - I'd like to see at least some bare minimum CSS practice.
using a template is fine, but it should be your own template and one without all the un=needed bootstrap files. *Not enough commits - please do one initial commit with skeleton framework and then one commit per code change - even if you wrote your logic all in one go, I would need to see one commit for the frontend minimum and one for the backend. Commit"add basic number input to html, add specs to readme, add ability to h… …andle 3,5,15 to js" -> 3 commits minimum! Moving forward projects without satisfactory commit history will have to be redone :( :( :(
